## Publication
  
## Code location
We have two versions of implementations, one is implemented in Java, and another is implemented in C++ with parallel in pthread.

Java version:  [LabelInference](https://github.com/linhongseba/CrossLPTripartite/tree/master/LabelInference)

C++ version:   [LabelInference(CPP)](https://github.com/linhongseba/CrossLPTripartite/tree/master/LabelInference%28cpp%29)

## Installation
### C++
    - Make sure that a g++ compiler that supports c++11 was intalled in your local machine
    - Make sure that pthread library was intalled in your local machine
    - Enter into LabelInference(cpp) folder, and type make to compile the file
    
### Java
    - Compile with IDE Netbeans, see detailed instruction from
    
    (https://netbeans.org/kb/73/java/project-setup.html?print=yes#existing-java-sources)
